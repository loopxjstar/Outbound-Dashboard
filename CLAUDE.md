```

## Enhanced Validation & Preprocessing System ✅

### Phase 0: Comprehensive File Validation (BEFORE Processing)
```python
# Step 1: Column Mapping & Header Validation
'send_mails': {
    'Recipient Name': 'recipient_name',    # User header → System header
    'Date': 'sent_date',                   # User header → System header
    'Recipient Email': 'Recipient Email'   # Keep as-is
}
'open_mails': {
    'Recipient': 'recipient_name',         # User header → System header
    'Sent': 'sent_date',                   # User header → System header
    'Opens': 'Views',                      # User header → System header
    'Clicks': 'Clicks',                   # Keep as-is
    'Last Opened': 'last_opened'          # User header → System header
}

# Step 2: Data Content Validation
- Date format validation (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS)
- Email format validation (contains @)
- Numeric validation (Views, Clicks)
- Empty file detection
- Missing column detection with clear error messages
```

### Advanced Data Preprocessing Rules

#### **Send Mails CSV Preprocessing:**
```python
# Rule 1: Domain Filtering
- Remove all records containing "loopwork.co" in Domain column
- Case-insensitive matching with detailed logging

# Rule 2: Time Adjustment  
- Add 9 hours 30 minutes to all sent_date values
- Automatic date rollover handling (e.g., 23:30 + 9:30 = next day 09:00)
- Before/after logging with date change indicators

# Rule 3: Recipient Name Cleaning
- Split by '<' symbol and extract part before '<'
- "Daniel Novak <dan@landish.ca>" → "Daniel Novak"
- "erin@landish.ca" → "erin@landish.ca" (no change if no '<')
- Automatic space trimming
```

#### **Open Mails CSV Preprocessing:**
```python
# Rule 1: Recipient Name Comma Splitting
- Split by ',' and take first value only
- "Breanna Hughes,Bailee Cooper,Harshit Gupta" → "Breanna Hughes"
- "John Doe" → "John Doe" (no change if no comma)

# Rule 2: Date Format Standardization
- Convert from "Jul 3, 2025, 02:14:21" to "03/07/2025 02:14:21"
- Handles various month name formats automatically
- Flexible parsing with fallback to original on errors
```

## Data Processing Pipeline (COMPLETED) ✅

### Phase 1: Send-Open Join (Two-Phase Datetime Matching)
```python
# Phase 1: 0-11 second incremental matching (99.4% success rate)
# Phase 2: 12-60 second matching on failed records
# Final: 500/503 successful matches
# Enhanced error handling prevents division by zero errors
```

### Phase 2: Contacts Integration
```python
# Join on: send_open['Recipient Email'] = contacts['Email']
# Many-to-one matching (multiple send records → one contact)
# Result: 339 successful + 161 failed = 500 total (perfect count preservation)
# Safe division check: "No records matched with contacts sheet" error message
```

### Phase 3: Final Output (2-File System)
```python
# Final processing complete after Contacts integration
# Ready for dashboard analytics and filtering with Company URL data
# Account History integration removed for simplified processing
```

## Advanced Dashboard Features (COMPLETED) ✅

### Dashboard Filters
- **📅 Sent Date Range**: Dynamic date picker for time-based filtering
- **🔄 Reset Filters**: One-click filter reset functionality  
- **📊 Filter Summary**: Shows "X records (filtered from Y total)"
- **Note**: Account Owner filter removed in 2-file system

### KPI Cards (7 Total)
1. **Total Sends**: Count of filtered records
2. **Total Views**: Sum of Views column
3. **Total Clicks**: Sum of Clicks column  
4. **View Rate**: (Total Views / Total Sends) × 100
5. **Open Rate**: Based on last_opened column analysis
6. **Accounts Owned**: Unique count of Company URL IDs
7. **High Engagement Accounts**: Count of companies where Total Views > 2 × Total Emails Sent

### Analytics Features
- **Real-time filtering**: All KPIs and charts update instantly
- **Time-series analysis**: Week-on-Week and Month-on-Month trends
- **Interactive charts**: Plotly-powered visualizations
- **Data export**: Download successful and failed records separately
- **Failed record analysis**: Separate sections for different failure types

## Final Data Model ✅

### Required CSV Columns with Enhanced Validation ✨
1. **Send Mails CSV**:
   - `recipient_name` (for datetime join) - Auto-cleaned and standardized
   - `sent_date` (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format) - +9:30 hours adjustment applied
   - `Recipient Email` (for contacts join) - Validated email format

2. **Open Mails CSV**:
   - `recipient_name` (for datetime join) - Auto-cleaned and standardized 
   - `sent_date` (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format) - No time adjustment
   - `Views` (renamed from "Opens") - Numeric validation
   - `Clicks` - Numeric validation

3. **Internal Contacts Database** (data/contacts.csv):
   - `Email` (join key) - Email format validation
   - `Company URL` (for company mapping) - Auto-filtered (excludes loopwork.co)
   - All other contact fields (merged to final output)

~~4. **Account History CSV** (REMOVED in 2-file system)~~


### Final Output Schema
```
send_open_contacts = 
  Send Mails fields (with +9:30 hours adjustment) +
  Open Mails fields (Views, Clicks) +
  All Contacts fields (filtered for loopwork.co domains) +
  Company URL ID (unique incremental ID) +
  Enhanced validation status and error tracking
```

## Processing Results ✅
- **Input**: 503 Send Mails records
- **Send-Open Join**: 500 successful (99.4% success rate)
- **Contacts Join**: 339 successful (67.8% success rate) 
- **Final Output**: 339 complete records + 164 failed records
- **Perfect Count Preservation**: Input = Output (no duplicate creation)
- **Note**: Account History processing removed in 2-file system

## Advanced Join Algorithms (IMPLEMENTED) ✅

### Two-Phase Datetime Matching
```python
# Phase 1: Try 0, +1, +2, ..., +11 seconds for each email
# Phase 2: Try +12, +13, ..., +60 seconds on failed records only
# Handles timing differences between send and open events
# Avoids duplicate matching by tracking used open records
```

### Many-to-One Contact Matching with Division by Zero Prevention
```python
# Creates lookup dictionary from contacts (first occurrence wins)
# Iterates through send-open records individually
# Merges all contact fields to each matching send-open record
# Maintains exact record count (no pandas merge duplicates)
# Safe division check: if len(send_open_df) > 0 before calculations
# Enhanced error handling: "No records matched with contacts sheet"
# 3-tuple return format: (successful_data, failed_data, validation_errors)
```

## Enhanced Error Handling & User Experience ✅

### Comprehensive Error Messages
```python
# File Validation Errors
❌ **Missing File**: Send Mails CSV is required but not uploaded.
❌ **Empty File**: Open Mails CSV contains no data rows.
❌ **Missing Columns**: 'Recipient Name' (maps to 'recipient_name'), 'Date' (maps to 'sent_date')
📋 **Available Columns in the uploaded sheet**: Date, Subject, Email, Domain

# Data Format Errors  
❌ **Date Format Error**: 3 rows have invalid date format in 'sent_date'. Expected: DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS
❌ **Email Format Error**: 2 rows have invalid email format in 'Email'
❌ **Numeric Format Error**: 1 rows have non-numeric values in 'Views'

# Processing Errors
❌ **No records matched with contacts sheet**: No emails from Send-Open data found in Contacts CSV
❌ **Join Error**: Failed to join Send Mails and Open Mails data
❌ **File Processing Error**: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte (encoding issues)
```

### User-Friendly Features
- **Clear column mapping explanations**: Shows what user headers map to internally
- **Before/after examples**: Shows data transformations with visual indicators
- **Progress logging**: Detailed processing steps with emoji indicators  
- **Safe division**: Prevents "division by zero" errors
- **Encoding flexibility**: Handles different file encodings automatically

### Company URL ID System
```python
# Generates unique incremental IDs (1, 2, 3...) for each Company URL
# Same URL gets same ID across all records
# Used for Account History join and "Accounts Owned" KPI
```
