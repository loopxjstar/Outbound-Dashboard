## Final Architecture âœ…
```
[5 CSV Uploads] â†’ [Streamlit App] â†’ [Advanced Data Pipeline] â†’ [Interactive Dashboard]
                                         â†“
    [Send-Open Join] â†’ [Contacts Join] â†’ [Account History Join] â†’ [Opportunity Details Join]
                                         â†“
                    [339 Final Records + 164 Failed Records] â†’ [Filtered Analytics + Opportunity KPIs]
```

## Data Processing Pipeline (COMPLETED) âœ…

### Phase 1: Send-Open Join (Two-Phase Datetime Matching)
```python
# Phase 1: 0-11 second incremental matching (99.4% success rate)
# Phase 2: 12-60 second matching on failed records
# Final: 500/503 successful matches
```

### Phase 2: Contacts Integration
```python
# Join on: send_open['Recipient Email'] = contacts['Email']
# Many-to-one matching (multiple send records â†’ one contact)
# Result: 339 successful + 161 failed = 500 total (perfect count preservation)
```

### Phase 3: Account History Integration
```python
# Company URL unique ID generation (1-64)
# Join on: contacts['Company URL'] = account_history['Company URL']
# Latest edit date selection with proper sorting
# Result: 21/64 Company URLs found in Account History
```

### Phase 4: Opportunity Details Integration âœ¨ (NEW)
```python
# Pre-processing: Deduplicate opportunities by Company URL (keep latest Created Date)
# Join on: final_data['Company URL'] = opportunity_details['Company URL']
# One-to-one mapping: Each Company URL has single opportunity record
# All opportunity fields attached to matching Company URLs
# Empty values for Company URLs without opportunities
```

## Advanced Dashboard Features (COMPLETED) âœ…

### Dashboard Filters
- **ðŸ“… Sent Date Range**: Dynamic date picker for time-based filtering
- **ðŸ‘¤ Account Owner**: Dropdown filter with all unique owners + "All" option
- **ðŸ”„ Reset Filters**: One-click filter reset functionality
- **ðŸ“Š Filter Summary**: Shows "X records (filtered from Y total)"

### KPI Cards (9 Total)
1. **Total Sends**: Count of filtered records
2. **Total Views**: Sum of Views column
3. **Total Clicks**: Sum of Clicks column  
4. **View Rate**: (Total Views / Total Sends) Ã— 100
5. **Open Rate**: Based on last_opened column analysis
6. **Accounts Owned**: Unique count of Company URL IDs
7. **Total Opportunity Amount**: Sum of opportunity amounts (one per Company URL) filtered by Latest edit date and Account Owner âœ¨ (NEW)
8. **Time to Opportunity**: Average days from Latest edit date to Created Date (latest opportunity per Company URL) âœ¨ (NEW)
9. **High Engagement Accounts**: Count of companies where Total Views > 2 Ã— Total Emails Sent âœ¨ (NEW)

### Analytics Features
- **Real-time filtering**: All KPIs and charts update instantly
- **Time-series analysis**: Week-on-Week and Month-on-Month trends
- **Interactive charts**: Plotly-powered visualizations
- **Data export**: Download successful and failed records separately
- **Failed record analysis**: Separate sections for different failure types

## Final Data Model âœ…

### Required CSV Columns
1. **Send Mails CSV**:
   - `recipient_name` (for datetime join)
   - `sent_date` (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format)
   - `Recipient Email` (for contacts join) âœ¨

2. **Open Mails CSV**:
   - `recipient_name` (for datetime join)
   - `sent_date` (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format)
   - `Views` (renamed from "Opens")
   - `Clicks`

3. **Contacts CSV**:
   - `Email` (join key)
   - `Company URL` (for account history join)
   - All other contact fields (merged to final output)

4. **Account History CSV**:
   - `Edit Date` (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format)
   - `Company URL` (join key)
   - `New Value`
   - `Account Owner`

5. **Opportunity Details CSV** âœ¨ (NEW):
   - `Company URL` (join key)
   - `Amount` (numeric opportunity value)
   - `Created Date` (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format)

### Final Output Schema
```
send_open_contacts_account_history_opportunities = 
  Send Mails fields +
  Open Mails fields (Views, Clicks) +
  All Contacts fields +
  Account History fields (Latest edit date, Account Owner, New Value) +
  Opportunity Details fields (Amount, Created Date) +
  Company URL ID (unique incremental ID)
```

## Processing Results âœ…
- **Input**: 503 Send Mails records
- **Send-Open Join**: 500 successful (99.4% success rate)
- **Contacts Join**: 339 successful (67.8% success rate) 
- **Account History**: 21/64 Company URLs matched
- **Final Output**: 339 complete records + 164 failed records
- **Perfect Count Preservation**: Input = Output (no duplicate creation)

## Advanced Join Algorithms (IMPLEMENTED) âœ…

### Two-Phase Datetime Matching
```python
# Phase 1: Try 0, +1, +2, ..., +11 seconds for each email
# Phase 2: Try +12, +13, ..., +60 seconds on failed records only
# Handles timing differences between send and open events
# Avoids duplicate matching by tracking used open records
```

### Many-to-One Contact Matching
```python
# Creates lookup dictionary from contacts (first occurrence wins)
# Iterates through send-open records individually
# Merges all contact fields to each matching send-open record
# Maintains exact record count (no pandas merge duplicates)
```

### Company URL ID System
```python
# Generates unique incremental IDs (1, 2, 3...) for each Company URL
# Same URL gets same ID across all records
# Used for Account History join and "Accounts Owned" KPI
```
